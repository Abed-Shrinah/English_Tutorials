Aaise hi: Just like that
Chashm deed gavah
Sari problems chali jaayaingi
Maine manaane ki koshish ki, Par nahi maana
Kab time ho jata hai pata hi nahi chalta
Yaar khane ke baad Saambar khatam ho jata hai
Agar kal tu help kar deta, to aaj subhe tak kaam khatam ho gya hota.
Agar main PM hota, country better condition me hota.
Agar main last monday ko nikal chuka hota, to parson kat wapis bhi aa jata.
