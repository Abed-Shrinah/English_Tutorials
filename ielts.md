## IELTS Acadamic Exam
Writing Instrument: You can use Pen or Pencil
Scoring: There is NO NEGATIVE marking for wrong answers. Scores are then converted to "Band Score" for that section.
Assessment is done on:
  - Fluency and Coherence: "Fluency" means how well you can speak continuously without needing to stop. "Coherence" means how clearly you organize and join your ideas together when you speak.
  - Lexical resource: It refers to the range of vocabulary to express your ideas clearly
  - Grammatical range and Accuracy: This means how well can you use English grammar.
  - Pronounciation (in Listening section)
Caution:
  - Be careful about spelling and grammar

### Listening Section:
  - Length: 30 minutes (listening) + 10 minutes (transfer time)
  - Scoring: You get 1 mark for each correct answer.
  - Flow:
    - Recording (Digital audio track) is started by supervisor and plays non-stop until it finishes approximately 30 minutes later. It contains 4 listening sections along with the instructions that you'll hear before, during and after each listening section. At the end of the recording you are given 10 minutes to transfers answers to answer sheet.
    - There are 4 sub-sections in "listening". Each sub-section is independent of each other and has two parts with 5 questions each. So, in total *Listening Section* has (5 questions)\*(2 parts)\*(4 sub-sections) = 40 question.
    - At the beginning of each sub-section you get "30 seconds pause" for scanning through questions from 1-5, then a "30 seconds pause" is the middle before the beginning of 2nd part so that you can scan through question number 5-10. At the end of the sub-section again you get "30 seconds pause". This time is for checking your answers quickly (for grammer and spelling mistakes). So, you get "30 seconds pause" before start of each part and more over "30 seconds pause" at that end of each sub-section. But, note that in "sub-section 1", you will be provided with an example also. So, basically, the "sub-section 1" has 3 parts: an example, part-1 and part-2.
  - Notes:
    - During "listening time" you listen to the audio recording and answer question on the question paper itself, and then use the "transfer time" to copy answers to answer sheet
    - Each recording can be heard only once
    - Answers in the recording are in the **same order** as the questions in the question paper, irrrespective to the question type
    - Difficulty level increases from 1st section to 4th section
  - Strategy:
    - Before starting a part of sub-section: (30s pause)
      - The instructor in recording tell you about topic of sub-section (such as "telephone conversation about parking permits") before part-1 of each sub-section. Listen it carefully, as it is not given on the question paper.
      - Before listening to recording, go through question of that part in given 30 seconds and underline the keywords
      - Pay attention to speaker's name in Question
    - While Listening the recording:
      - Pay attention starting from the first sentence of Recording
      - Pay attention to "Who said what and what's his/her opinion?"
      - Note that in a single sentence there might be answers for multiple questions
      - Pay attention to all factual information
      - Mark answers on "Question Paper" while listening
      - You should be aware of atleast next two un-answered questions (as there are chances that within the same sentence you can get answer to two questions). In order to be able to do this, you need to practice on "Listening while reading"
      - Pay attention to Speaker's name in Question
      - Make sure your answer is matches gramatically with question. For example,
        - "three officies in Austrialia" (right) vs. "three officies in Sydney, Bresbane, Melbourne".
        - "sometimes work in other countries" (right) vs. "sometimes work in overseas"
        - if the expected answer is "over 2 hours" then, "2 hours" and "over 2 hour" both with be incorrect. But note that in case of senetence completion or form completion, such as "it weighted more than ...... tons", the answer can be "30", but not "over 30".
        - Answer to "how long" can be "6 months" but not "6 montsh ago"
        - write money in correct way (such as, $ 10)
      - Make sure you don't repeat words (just before or just after) words from the question. For example,
        - "507, ...11... Street, Knightsbridge, London" (right) vs. "507, ...11 Street... Street, Knightsbridge, London"
      - Make sure spelling of each word in the answer is correct.
        - avoid spelling mistake by writing "6" instead of "six", etc.
        - don't use abbreviations
      - Most of the time question paper gives instructions such as **NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER**, **NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER**, or **NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS**. These limitations are for "Short Answers" or "Sentence Completion" or "Form/notes/flowchart" type questions. Here use ONLY the words/number (not synomyms) as given in the recording. Moreover the words in the SAME FORM as you hear in the recording. More sure answer adhere to these instructions. Check Answering Rules (Options/Words, Word limit, Positive/Negative)
      - In "labeling diagram/map" and "classification" questions, you are suppose the write options numbers/letters (such as, A, B, C, etc.) not the option's words itself
      - If you missed an answer, mark the question and keep listening for further answers and parallely read further questions. Try to answer the missed question after the section is finished.
      - Check that you haven't used words instead of option letters where options letters are supposed to be entered
      - Summary/Conclusion
    - Pay heed at listened words:
      - "isn't" vs. "is"
      - "B" vs. "P"
      - The matching word that you here in recording is not always the answer, as sometimes there are twists. For example, if it the speaker says: "this disease isn't Summer problem", then the problem occurs in seasons other than summers
    - After end of a section: (30s pause)
      - Reasoable guess for un-attempted questions
      - Check your answers for grammer, spelling and answering instructions
    - Transer time at the end of 4th Section: 10 minutes
      - This time you get at the end of 4th Section. Use this time to transfer answers from "Question Paper" to "Answer Sheet". Note that there are no points for the answers written on the question paper even if they are correct.
      - Make sure this time just used to transfering answer, and not for checking spellings, grammer, word limits, or guessing the answer. It is important to write answers at right place in the answer sheet.
      - In case of mistake on answer sheet, just strike out that answer and write correct answer next to it (if space is available). This way you can avoid using eraser and hence wasting time.
      - In case of missed answer, make a reasonable guess as there is NO NEGATIVE marking.

### Writing Section:
  - Duration: 60 minutes (with NO transfer time)
  - Scoring: Task 2 contributes twice as much as Task 1 to writing score
  - Sub Sections (Tasks):
    Both the task are completely independent of each other.
    You should write both the tasks in **full sentences** (not in bullet-points or notes).
    - Sub-Section 1 (Task 1):
      - Write atleast 150 words in 20 minutes
      - You will receive information in visual form and a statement explaining what the visual shows.
      - You need to summarise (in own words) the information in the visual
      - Note: In order to understand the visual data, first look at the following:
        - Title of visual
        - Labels of axis
      - Note: You are NOT ALLOWED to speculate the reason behind the pattern of the given data
      - Note: If you are given two visuals, then you are suppose to describe both of them and also how they are related/un-related
      - What all to include in answer?
        1. Topic: Write 1 or 2 sentences that:
          - Introduce the general topic of visual
          - Explain the type of information it shows
          - Don't copy the given topic word by word, instead paraphrase it. For example, for topic such as "The graph below shows the percentages of males and females of different ages employed in Australia", a good paraphrase could be "The chart illustrates the proportion of men and women from various age groups who are working in Australia". This way you demonstrate your range of vocabular and command on grammar.
        2. Overview: Write 1 or 2 sentences that:
          - Describe the main trend(s)/finding(s)
          - Place it "at the beginning" (after the introductory sentence) or "at the end". It is good to place it in the beginning as you might skip it if you are running out of time at the end.
          - Example: "Overall, it can be seen that the use of petroleum and coal fell slightly over the period. On the other hand, there were slight increases in the use of natural gas and nuclear energy".
        3. Rest of the description:
          - If you place the overview in the beginning, then you can start with other conclusion using "On the other hand...". For example, "On the other hand, there were slight increases in the use of natural gas and nuclear energey".
          - Add which places, people or things is the information about?
          - Add how many different things are being compared?
          - Add what units are used to show the amounts, numbers or proportions?
          - Add what period of time does the visual refers to?
          - Add key features (apart from overview) including trends (changes over time) and comparisons (similarities and differences)
            - Example: The comsumption of petroleum peaked at over 50% in 1973, then gradually declined over the next 12 years. Since 1985, the global petroleum comsumption has remained stable at 40%.
            - Example: The influence of Latin and French on English is exactly the same at 29%, and Germanic language have influenced English almost as much at 26%. Together, these three languages groups make up more than 80% of the origin of English.
            - Example: In contrast, Greek, other languages and proper names have had a significantly smaller influence on the origins of English, at 6%, 6% and 4% respectively.
          - You must mention data to support what you write.
          - Note: Carefully choose your tenses to match the time.
    - Sub-Section 2 (Task 2):
      - Write atleast 250 words in 40 minutes
      - You will receive a point of view, an issue, or a problem presented as a question or as a statement.
      - You need to wriet an academic essay (in own words)
